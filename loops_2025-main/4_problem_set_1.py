# # **Python Practice Problems (No Code Included)

# **Directions:** Solve each problem by writing your own Python code. Show outputs where required.


# # ### **Problem 1: Print Numbers 1 to 10
# list1to10= list(range(1,11))
# for number in list1to10 :
#     print(number)
# # Write a program that prints the numbers from **1 to 10**, each on a new line.
# n = int(input("enter a number:"))
# total_sum = 0
# for number in range(1,n +1):
#     total_sum += number
# # ### **Problem 2: Sum of Numbers

# Ask the user for a number **n**, then calculate and display the **sum of all numbers from 1 to n**.



# ### **Problem 3: Factorial Calculator
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
    
def factorial(n):

    factorial= 1

    for i in range(n):
        factorial*=i+1

    return factorial 
print (factorial(0))

# Ask the user for a number **n**, then calculate the **factorial** of that number.

# *(Example: factorial of 5 is 120)


# ### **Problem 4: Count Vowels**

# Ask the user for a string. Count and print how many **vowels (a, e, i, o, u)** are in the string.


# ### **Problem 5: Print Even Numbers**

# Ask the user for a number **n**, then print all **even numbers** from 2 up to n.
n =int(input("enter a number:"))
print("even numbers from 2 to", n, ":")
for number in range (2, n + 1,2):
    print(number)

list_even_numbers = list (range(1,45))
for number in list_even_numbers:
    if number % 2 ==0:
        print(number)
    else:
        print("odd number, skipping", number)


# ### **Problem 6: Reverse a String**
name = input ("enter a string:")
reversed_name = ""
for char in name :
    #looping through each character in the string and adding it to the front o fthe reversed string
    reversed_name_char = reversed_name
print("reversed string", reversed_name)
print(reversed_name[::-1])
# Ask the user for a string, then print the string **backwards**.



# ### **Problem 7: Multiplication Table**

# Ask the user for a number **n**, then print the **multiplication table** for n from
# n × 1 up to n × 10.



# ### **Problem 8: Count Occurrences**

# Ask the user for **two strings**, a and b.
# Determine how many times **string b appears inside string a**.



# ### **Problem 9: Fibonacci Sequence**
# 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 
def fibonacci(n):
    if n==1 or n==2:
        return 1
    return fibonacci(n-1)+ fibonacci(n-2)
for i in range(1, 10):
    print(fibonacci(i))

# Ask the user for a number **n**, then print the first **n numbers** of the Fibonacci sequence.
#fuc calls itself
def car_price (n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return car_price(n-1)+ car_price(n-2)
print(car_price)


# ### **Problem 10: Pattern Printing**

# Ask the user for a number **n**, then print a pattern of stars where the first row has 1 star, the second has 2, and so on until row n.

# *(Example for n = 4)*
# *
# **
# ***
# ****



# If you want, I can also turn this into a **Google Doc**, **worksheet**, **PDF**, or **Canvas/Schoology assignment format**.
