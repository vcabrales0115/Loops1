# # Given:
# colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "purple"]

# # Challenge:
# # Use a while loop to print each color UNTIL you find "yellow".
# index = 0
# while index <len (colors) :
#     if colors[index] == "yellow":
#         break
# print(colors[index])

# # Do NOT print "yellow" — stop before it.

#print one time
